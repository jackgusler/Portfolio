        From a young age, technoology always fascinated me. When I took my first
        computer science class in highschool, it was love at first 'code'. I
        quickly leanred that the thrills of problem solving and creating
        something from nothing was addicting, and I have been programming ever
        since.

        Currently, I'm actively seeking job opportunities while concurrently
        working on various projects to further develop my skills and knowledge.
        I am very excited to get out into the world and start my career as a
        software engineer!
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not immersed in code, you can catch me going on hikes with
        friends, watching shows with my girlfriend and two cats, or cheering for
        the Rangers!
